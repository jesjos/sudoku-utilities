# Sudoku Utilities

This is a set of Sudoku utilities written in Ruby.

Included utilities:

1. Sudoku solving
2. Checking for uniqueness of solution
3. Analysis of Sudoku difficulty
4. Generating Sudokus of different difficulties

# Usage

## Ruby code

Just read the specs :)

## Web interface

There are three methods of booting the web interface:

1. `ruby ./lib/sudoku-web/webapp.rb`
2. `rackup config.ru`
3. `foreman start` <- preferred for development

## Command line utility

### Getting started

You need to make `bin/sudoku_utilities.rb` executable to be able to run the commands.

### Listing commands

    > ./bin/sudoku_utilities.rb

### Reading

The utility expects a file containing nine rows of nine columns each. 
Digits other than 1..9 will be considered to represent empty squares.

    > ./bin/sudoku_utilities.rb read -f ./spec/test_grids/samuraj.txt
      5.....1.7
      ..43..5..
      ...2...8.
      .9.4.2...
      4.......6
      ...1.3.5.
      .8...4...
      ..2..67..
      3.9.....1

### Solving

    > ./bin/sudoku_utilities.rb solve -f ./spec/test_grids/samuraj.txt

### Analyzing

    > ./bin/sudoku_utilities.rb analyze -f ./spec/test_grids/samuraj.txt
      Sudoku difficulty is samuraj

### Generating

The available difficulties are:

- easy
- medium
- hard
- samuraj

At the time of writing, difficulties are naÃ¯ve and only based upon the number of given squares.

N.B - Sudoku generation can take several tens of seconds.

    > ./bin/sudoku_utilities.rb generate -d samuraj
